# CacheImplementation
Implemented a 256 Byte Direct Mapped, byte addressable cache with an 8 byte line size. Included read and write operation support. Implemented a write-miss, write policy for the cache and a write allocate write miss policy.   Furthermore, I improvised on the direct mapped cache to build a 240 byte,  6 way set associative cache with a 4 byte line size. Implemented write back, write allocate and a Least Recently Used (LRU) replacement policy.
